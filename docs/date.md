# To exploit various “adventuring in groups” buffs, becoming unstoppable and legendary 

## High level
- 29
- Male
- Kinsey 2
- Seeking coparent(s)
- Polyam
- In Philly. In theory ready to move on to somewhere else, in practice too enamored with my housemates to think about it. 
- [Big five results here](https://bigfive-test.com/result/623617c0d5e3dd000926c0bd) (I only assign like 45% confidence to the idea that big five isn’t just astrology in other clothes, though). 
- Actively want to invest bandwidth in relationships that aren't on any kind of escalator toward nesting and coparenting, but I don't want to nest with a partner who doesn't want kids (barring some grouphouse-polycule scenario). 

## My notion of intimacy (emotional/interpersonal): 

I have two completely contradictory ways of thinking about love, and they both follow from the same prompt: _do they surprise me or is my model of them adequate?_ I think the generative thought experiment is if a mad scientist offered to clone them based only on my model of them I have stored in my brain, how would that go? Would the clone act in ways that the original endorses? Vice versa, do I hope that a clone of me based only on the model of me in my lover’s brain accomplishes his goals? Etc. In one sense it’s incredibly romantic to be consistently wrong (i.e. surprised) about my lover’s behavior or thoughts (incompressibility and so on). In another sense, it’s really intimate to anticipate and predict accurately how they’ll respond and feel.

## My notion of intimacy (physical)

### On various redacted R-rated things

I have a lot of personalities, none of which have deal-breakers in mind. But I estimate that I'm `1.2 to 1.8` standard deviations hornier than most of the people I know well. Preferences/kink list upon request. 

## Testimonials

> “...Wow what a lad. Such a cool and friendly and calm dude”

– Local from a town I visited for three weeks

> “One of the guys of all time” 

– Housemate of over a year

## Informative anecdotes from my life: 

- **Intellectually**: I read the [intelligence.org/research-guide](https://intelligence.org/research-guide/) when I was 24 and abandoned everything I had dumped my life into up till then and dove into math and CS, because I thought AI alignment looked reasonably easy (narrator: AI alignment was not reasonably easy). 
- **Academically**: I have failed at consuming approximately 90% of the textbooks I’ve set my sights on, but that other 10% earned me the distinguished reputation of “guy who can just sit down with textbooks and learn stuff” amongst a couple friends. 
- **Professionally**: I turned down `$200k`/yr for `$70k`/yr. It wasn’t even because the 200 job had lower skillbuild or less daily intellectual satisfaction with the low level execution of the job, but because the 70 job is associated with longshot massive social upside. (In effective altruist lingo we’d call it “direct work”).
- **Aesthetically**: [This song](https://youtu.be/0l4SJqm_2pA) is deeply moving, it’s the first time I fell in love with a song instantly (usually they have to slow burn). [This novel is deeply moving](http://www.hpmor.com/), usually what I tell people is “my favorite novel”. There exists a film that several people across separate friend groups have rolled their eyes smiling in non-surprise when I said it’s one of my faves, because apparently its essence is just in sync with my personality, but I’m not going to tell you what movie that is until you get to know me a little bit, it’s more fun that way. 

## For the plausible coparents

I'm not super in a rush, but I would prefer to be systematic and reveal information about our mutual fit in a clever and efficient way. I'm probably willing to try nesting after knowing someone for about 6 months, unclear how long I want to nest with them before childrearing however. 

One slice of my expected parenting values: humans need to be able to _own their consequences_ and _pick what hills they'd like to die on_ in order to cultivate agency. For this reason, I think 1. school needs to be approached cautiously and rigorously; and 2. we need to thread a needle where we help our children follow through on projects without it turning into us projecting what sorts of projects we'd like them to be doing. That said, I would like to find out how to raise second-generation transhumanist altruists without various "indoctrination"-related failure modes.

Another slice: Leonard Bernstein, speaking I imagine about orchestral or broadway productions, said "_to accomplish great things, two things are needed: a plan, and almost enough time_". I expect to have almost enough time (i.e. readiness) to parent, to do any of my other goals, and I've worked to cultivate heuristics around when perfect should or shouldn't be the enemy of the good. I also avoid appealing to normal distributions, I avoid looking at the world and saying "look at all the people in a way lower percentile of such n such virtue or trait than me seeming to do alright, surely I can relax", because I don't like to impose an upper bound on my standards. 

I'm inclined toward more than one kid because someone made an intuitive argument that the marginal cost of each additional kid declines. [I have begun an estimate of this argument](https://www.squiggle-language.com/playground/#code=eNqtV0tz4zYM%2FiuYXFZyHVl24mTHM3tq02lmdqeHpNND02oYibZYS6RKUpa9m%2Fz3AqQdW9LGebS5WKLw%2BAB8AJFvJyZXzU1dlkxvTmZW13zojq4yYZXenQgprGDFzT%2B1WCwKfmO1kIuT2Qm%2BS5k0ShfZSvAGPsG3Own4Z0XJk1QZm6h5MhcaH9JcFFlScZ00nC9nMJmCVTCexEMYjUBIyFWtDQQCcrbiIBWIjDNocmZBfCjBsmKJXoHdq9qG3k0mTKpqaRPNLE%2FI6Qzi6OLSmY6jj2Q54ynbgJoDhrgQkhXA11YzBxGEBUJpSJ5lGTBJPxisIsGlyO7k453cILLvRYnWfxZFQeBJhOBgZu5rUjeQc80j%2BCIkB6Y5VAVLea6KjGvz6iR1Ehy9qDJ8PjFdW30ZF%2BydfNEJZqAUa1trHrwdILSz%2BbIG1lrWZVJhEiVWCn2vg8kQxtEFVe0swuc%2F6P3PkApSqIZr4DKjkv94DcJApdU9uxeFsI4HCguCzLI5BcEzaAQ%2Bsuzv2tgSPcBcaUB4SzBpzrO64OZVSXEPHiRifDmHIziIijwQ%2F4tNsmJFzUmLMCQIJuEszfeWz2PXN9MpRXuNrF4ivwzFTT%2Fn8SjXRMhMaJ5aF8gQkJLQ4Fc1nyMpMxjHUxJDO8Zic5A4n4sIzaHSUkkQc3xGLqMsCpVsLUrxlYOHCEQY%2FI7sKTK45%2BQEU1hXDdMZOSF0DgY23QZSRI4lWfLKQqlW1MN3sqTUuI5PNGcFNo5IWYHhE2AUSYT0WTVMGp86jB%2FDP3PhT6eUsT6DjzCzL9yjYl8kbE0Qm%2FPXTRFwgAFrDZ7zIsJRUDK5AZZascIBw42bChmxESvDYKFVXUX9sFJmcgwrjrZD7fJyemysOfHjY82BixymoQclLC8NqkqqpuantcHCYxuYHDGiKKFCn7%2FdXn%2B%2Bvr2%2BupmBp6vZlQkBTs5hAJd3kl7d%2BYYzjefTyYHs9qytO4CWzmEKeOabiDJhXDNQ0%2BBcNkErSyEN5YfdtwfwUxCx1ykP%2FAv9lawKPiPXorq6VQHePDuNcIjq64f23IS%2FYP2IX%2Fb68eELKgw3D7CGH2Dz6I%2FD7QQ9gL8fBP0YEPRbA%2FWsbCcIK%2F5%2FeiB7IUVRqIXry2CDA2AISON17BONmaIznGHBGMPn6yo4BSpksIZTkgpDlwcjFqUS2Y4iTwZb9cfRjYY6R3G4196Spq9NHzra%2FuhQ243RLoD3jR%2Fv6726PVDduN45Ezvt819AomLHVhxue%2F%2F2lyv48utPV5%2Bp959IHTw10H4r6pJfyBX3V6vnXpuTx%2Fpjb727MB1sIm%2B6mAcvoxu07%2BW%2B323Z2nNu8B1wXvmQxUHf0m5kzHGGyxSX7GfzikXIra3MbDRqmiaqTcaihVqNSp4JNrpHGo0m8fhyFI9H47MRWTnVTBgs9qlLiLdCaglGLErqdVKg2X12djGOyUPDP7grXQtcfnBDyPFOoGsP9wS7JRHMWSlwC7A57lY7S7RnYem8j6cA%2FTX4CZd5XbIi6PtGgkXxGLPX%2FxQ%2Bh7c74DreWiU%2BNhu77HrB0245VvZ4jX6ndVJVFe5EtaSVk2TpMi3ot2ELfsCqQ%2F528Wwv%2FueIcWBkAL25ErxmmwxxdpOXbWgIPj4VMuNr2tFwC0Rf9D%2BQmTkKxBgXL7jbkbHaPiy%2FFLm28%2F8u9a7Yj3iD7pMWnjz%2BC27aPUE%3D) (you can plug-and-play your worldview by substituting some input parameters), though it may be buggy, miss too many considerations, or provide information that's an order of magnitude less valuable than our emotional state after the first child would be. 

## Logistics

For people who don't want kids, I am not interested in relationships across an excess of three hours ground transport at this time. But a distance trial with plans to nest to test mutual fit for coparenting is not so constrained, on my end. 

I will attempt to reach out to everyone who is nominated on my Manifold Market, you're encouraged to self-nominate on Manifold before emailing me but it is not a requirement.
