Stunning book, stopped me in my tracks. I'm somewhat of a positively-motivated person; I have a vision of success and I try to steer the future into that vision. Suffering focused ethics argues that this is completely wrong, philosophically and practically, deriving from the asymmetry between suffering and happiness.
