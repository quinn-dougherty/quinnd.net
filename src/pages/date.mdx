</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Type of Guy">
  <p>
    Zest for life / high hedonic setpoint, really into epistemic cooperation in the sense of strong injunctions against manipulation/witholding (as well as all the other "believing true things is hard" stuff), my "golden rule" / kantian intuitions run very deep so many asymmetries are on thin ice. 
  </p>

    Woman, romance, cofounder for parenting projects, spouse, housemate

## Swoonworthy traits

<Tabs lazy>
  <TabItem value="sincerity" label="Sincerity">
    Irony is poison. I admire anyone who's above average in earnestness. 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="analyticalness" label="Analyticalness">
    My mathematics training is a part of my worldview, and I get along best with people who can relate to that. Related, I'm into atheism/irreligiosity and sometimes getting close with other kinds of people takes a little extra effort.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="conviction" label="Conviction">
    Taking values seriously enough let them inform behavior is critical. I don't mean <i>loyalty</i> to convictions, but I mean honoring commitments for however long they seem like the right commitments. 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="compassion" label="Compassion">
    I often feel like I experience few visceral/involuntary empathy signals, and while there are so many advantages of engaging with empathy on an opt-in basis, I'd like to be in a support role for someone who feels conscripted into caring about others. 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ambition" label="Ambition">
    I want to be with goal-directed people. 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="introspectiveness" label="Introspectiveness">
    There's nothing wrong with having uncertainty about internal state, but in basically every situation it's much better to stare at it and report as much as possible about the uncertainty than to give up. 
  </TabItem>

## Reach out

- Email: `quinnd@riseup.net`
- Would love to pivot to signal > sms > element/matrix > telegram > some mutual slack we happen to both be in after a brief exchange (I'm avoiding discord, I don't whatsapp or messenger)

### Openers / conversation menu

- How to threatmodel asymmetriees in romance: like agency, intensity (energy, voice volume), your favorite big five trait, status/prestige, IQ, libido, etc.
- Affection styles / love languages
- Your (least?) favorite failure mode of "Radical Honesty" -adjacent practices
- How you think about the poly vs monog question
- One of your "strong view weakly held" current childrearing beliefs/strats that you want my help to double check as a research project.
- Assembling furniture with someone: is this _inherently_ horny behavior or dependent on context?
