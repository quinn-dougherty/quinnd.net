    31 years old, male
  </p>
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Type of Guy">
  <p>
    Zest for life / high hedonic setpoint, really into epistemic cooperation in the sense of strong injunctions against manipulation/witholding (as well as all the other "believing true things is hard" stuff), my "golden rule" / kantian intuitions run very deep so many asymmetries are on thin ice. 
  </p>
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Seeking">
  <p>
    Woman, romance, spouse, housemate, cofounder for childrearing projects

<Admonition type="info" title="In Berkeley CA">
  <p>
    Unclear where to buy house / raise kids, though, and willing to travel a bunch for the first few months of dating a serious primary/coparent candidate.

## Traits to make me swoon

<Tabs lazy>
  <TabItem value="sincerity" label="Sincerity">
    Irony is poison. I admire anyone who's above average in earnestness. 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="analyticalness" label="Analyticalness">
    My mathematics training is a part of my worldview, and I get along best with people who can relate to that. 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="conviction" label="Conviction">
    Taking values seriously enough let them inform behavior is critical. I don't mean <i>loyalty</i> to convictions, but I mean honoring commitments for however long they seem like the right commitments. 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="compassion" label="Compassion">
    I often feel like I experience few visceral/involuntary empathy signals, and while there are so many advantages of engaging with empathy on an opt-in basis, I'd like to be in a support role for someone who feels conscripted into caring about others. 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ambition" label="Ambition">
    I want to be with goal-directed people. 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="introspectiveness" label="Introspectiveness">
    There's nothing wrong with having uncertainty about internal state, but in basically every situation it's much better to stare at it and report as much as possible about the uncertainty than to give up. 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Type of guy

- An ex once reported that I'm "really gung ho about the mortifying ordeal of being known".
- I ran Taco Wednesdays at my house for a few months. Mainly canceled them because I went on a long trip, but plan to resume monthly rather than weekly as things stabilize.
- Swam from alcatraz to SF.
- Really psyched about work, generally enjoy being someone who works a lot.
- Almost entirely vegetarian.
- Baby fever, but don't do a lot of thinking about my parenting values because I'd rather do that thinking as a group project with a special someone.
- Often singing and humming, hopefully a turning a loved one's name into song.
- I have at least two mysterious backstories. 
- Yes the kidney tshirt is real.
- One secret zest for life / high hedonic setpoint trait/behavior that it'd be more fun to surprise you with.

## Reach out

- Email: `quinn.dougherty92@gmail.com`
- Calendly: `calendly.com/quinn-dougherty`
- Would love to pivot to signal > sms > element/matrix > telegram > some mutual slack we happen to both be in after a brief exchange.

### Openers / conversation menu

- How to thing through asymmetries in romance: like agency, intensity (energy, voice volume), your favorite big five trait, status/prestige, IQ, libido, etc.
- Affection styles / love languages
- Your (least?) favorite failure mode of "Radical Honesty" -adjacent practices
- How you think about the poly vs monog question
- One of your "strong view weakly held" current childrearing beliefs/strats that you want my help to double check as a research project.
- Assembling furniture with someone: is this _inherently_ horny behavior or dependent on context?
