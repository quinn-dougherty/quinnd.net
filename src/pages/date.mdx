## Swoonworthy traits

<Tabs lazy>
  <TabItem value="sincerity" label="Sincerity">
    Irony is poison. I admire anyone who's above average in earnestness. 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="analyticalness" label="Analyticalness">
    My mathematics training is a part of my worldview, and I get along best with people who can relate to that. 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="conviction" label="Conviction">
    Taking values seriously enough let them inform behavior is critical. I don't mean <i>loyalty</i> to convictions, but I mean honoring commitments for however long they seem like the right commitments. 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="compassion" label="Compassion">
    I often feel like I experience few visceral/involuntary empathy signals, and while there are so many advantages of engaging with empathy on an opt-in basis, I'd like to be in a support role for someone who feels conscripted into caring about others. 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ambition" label="Ambition">
    I want to be with goal-directed people. 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="introspectiveness" label="Introspectiveness">
    I'm basically fanatical about this. There's nothing wrong with having uncertainty about internal state, but in basically every situation it's much better to stare at it and report as much as possible about the uncertainty than to give up.

## My notion of intimacy (physical)

- [x] Cuddling _a whole lot_
- [x] Drive-by hip-pinches
- [x] Eye contact
- [x] Pointing at you from afar and making a silly face

I have a lot of personalities (i.e. separable classes of preferences), none of which have deal-breakers in mind. But I estimate that I'm <code>1.2 to 1.8</code> standard deviations hornier than most of the people I know well. Preferences/kink list upon request.

## Informative anecdotes from my life

<Tabs lazy>
    <TabItem value="intellectually" label="Intellectually" default>
        I read the <a href="https://intelligence.org/research-guide/">MIRI research guide</a> when I was 24 and abandoned everything I had dumped my life into up till then and dove into math and CS, because I thought AI alignment looked reasonably easy (<i>narrator: AI alignment was not reasonably easy</i>). 
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="academically" label="Academically">
        I have failed at consuming approximately 90% of the textbooks I’ve set my sights on, but that other 10% earned me the distinguished reputation of “guy who can just sit down with textbooks and learn stuff” amongst a couple friends. 
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="professionally" label="Professionally">
        I turned down $200k/yr for $70k/yr. It wasn’t even because the 200 job had lower skillbuild or less daily intellectual satisfaction with the low level execution of the job, but because the 70 job is associated with longshot massive social upside. (In effective altruist lingo we’d call it “direct work”).
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="aesthetically" label="Aesthetically">
        <a href="https://youtu.be/0l4SJqm_2pA">This song is deeply moving</a>, it’s the first time I fell in love with a song instantly (usually they have to slow burn). <a href="http://www.hpmor.com/">This novel is deeply moving</a>, usually what I tell people is “my favorite novel”. There exists a film that several people across separate friend groups have rolled their eyes smiling in non-surprise when I said it’s one of my faves, because apparently its essence is just in sync with my personality, but I’m not going to tell you what movie that is until you get to know me a little bit, it’s more fun that way.

## For the plausible coparents

<details>
  <summary>
    Not very useful for readers who don't want kids
  </summary>
  <p>
    I'm not super in a rush, but I would prefer to be systematic and reveal information about our mutual fit in a clever and efficient way. I'm probably willing to try nesting after knowing someone for about 6 months, unclear how long I want to nest with them before childrearing however.

### One slice of my expected parenting values

Humans need to be able to _own their consequences_ and _pick what hills they'd like to die on_ in order to cultivate agency. For this reason, I think 1. school needs to be approached cautiously and rigorously; and 2. we need to thread a needle where we help our children follow through on projects without it turning into us projecting what sorts of projects we'd like them to be doing. That said, I would like to find out how to raise second-generation transhumanist altruists without various "indoctrination"-related failure modes.

### Another slice

Leonard Bernstein, speaking I imagine about orchestral or broadway productions, said "_to accomplish great things, two things are needed: a plan, and almost enough time_". I expect to have almost enough time (i.e. readiness) to parent, to do any of my other goals, and I've worked to cultivate heuristics around when perfect should or shouldn't be the enemy of the good. I also avoid appealing to normal distributions, I avoid looking at the world and saying "look at all the people in a way lower percentile of such n such virtue or trait than me seeming to do alright, surely I can relax", because I don't like to impose an upper bound on my standards.

### On how many

I'm inclined toward more than one kid because someone made an intuitive argument that the marginal cost of each additional kid declines. [I have begun an estimate of this argument](https://www.squiggle-language.com/playground/#code=eNqtV0tz4zYM%2FiuYXFZyHVl24mTHM3tq02lmdqeHpNND02oYibZYS6RKUpa9m%2Fz3AqQdW9LGebS5WKLw%2BAB8AJFvJyZXzU1dlkxvTmZW13zojq4yYZXenQgprGDFzT%2B1WCwKfmO1kIuT2Qm%2BS5k0ShfZSvAGPsG3Own4Z0XJk1QZm6h5MhcaH9JcFFlScZ00nC9nMJmCVTCexEMYjUBIyFWtDQQCcrbiIBWIjDNocmZBfCjBsmKJXoHdq9qG3k0mTKpqaRPNLE%2FI6Qzi6OLSmY6jj2Q54ynbgJoDhrgQkhXA11YzBxGEBUJpSJ5lGTBJPxisIsGlyO7k453cILLvRYnWfxZFQeBJhOBgZu5rUjeQc80j%2BCIkB6Y5VAVLea6KjGvz6iR1Ehy9qDJ8PjFdW30ZF%2BydfNEJZqAUa1trHrwdILSz%2BbIG1lrWZVJhEiVWCn2vg8kQxtEFVe0swuc%2F6P3PkApSqIZr4DKjkv94DcJApdU9uxeFsI4HCguCzLI5BcEzaAQ%2Bsuzv2tgSPcBcaUB4SzBpzrO64OZVSXEPHiRifDmHIziIijwQ%2F4tNsmJFzUmLMCQIJuEszfeWz2PXN9MpRXuNrF4ivwzFTT%2Fn8SjXRMhMaJ5aF8gQkJLQ4Fc1nyMpMxjHUxJDO8Zic5A4n4sIzaHSUkkQc3xGLqMsCpVsLUrxlYOHCEQY%2FI7sKTK45%2BQEU1hXDdMZOSF0DgY23QZSRI4lWfLKQqlW1MN3sqTUuI5PNGcFNo5IWYHhE2AUSYT0WTVMGp86jB%2FDP3PhT6eUsT6DjzCzL9yjYl8kbE0Qm%2FPXTRFwgAFrDZ7zIsJRUDK5AZZascIBw42bChmxESvDYKFVXUX9sFJmcgwrjrZD7fJyemysOfHjY82BixymoQclLC8NqkqqpuantcHCYxuYHDGiKKFCn7%2FdXn%2B%2Bvr2%2BupmBp6vZlQkBTs5hAJd3kl7d%2BYYzjefTyYHs9qytO4CWzmEKeOabiDJhXDNQ0%2BBcNkErSyEN5YfdtwfwUxCx1ykP%2FAv9lawKPiPXorq6VQHePDuNcIjq64f23IS%2FYP2IX%2Fb68eELKgw3D7CGH2Dz6I%2FD7QQ9gL8fBP0YEPRbA%2FWsbCcIK%2F5%2FeiB7IUVRqIXry2CDA2AISON17BONmaIznGHBGMPn6yo4BSpksIZTkgpDlwcjFqUS2Y4iTwZb9cfRjYY6R3G4196Spq9NHzra%2FuhQ243RLoD3jR%2Fv6726PVDduN45Ezvt819AomLHVhxue%2F%2F2lyv48utPV5%2Bp959IHTw10H4r6pJfyBX3V6vnXpuTx%2Fpjb727MB1sIm%2B6mAcvoxu07%2BW%2B323Z2nNu8B1wXvmQxUHf0m5kzHGGyxSX7GfzikXIra3MbDRqmiaqTcaihVqNSp4JNrpHGo0m8fhyFI9H47MRWTnVTBgs9qlLiLdCaglGLErqdVKg2X12djGOyUPDP7grXQtcfnBDyPFOoGsP9wS7JRHMWSlwC7A57lY7S7RnYem8j6cA%2FTX4CZd5XbIi6PtGgkXxGLPX%2FxQ%2Bh7c74DreWiU%2BNhu77HrB0245VvZ4jX6ndVJVFe5EtaSVk2TpMi3ot2ELfsCqQ%2F528Wwv%2FueIcWBkAL25ErxmmwxxdpOXbWgIPj4VMuNr2tFwC0Rf9D%2BQmTkKxBgXL7jbkbHaPiy%2FFLm28%2F8u9a7Yj3iD7pMWnjz%2BC27aPUE%3D) (you can plug-and-play your worldview by substituting some input parameters), though it may be buggy, miss too many considerations, or provide information that's an order of magnitude less valuable than our emotional state after the first child would be.

### On biology

I'm reasonably confident that bio-fathering is as good or better than rolling the dice at the sperm bank (in terms of my assessment of my family's disease and IQ history), but I'm not married to it. I am interested equally in arguments for embryo selection and in arguments for adoption: I think conditional on a partner feeling strongly about one of the two, the probability they'd convince me is a little over 80%.

## On polyamory

<Admonition type="info" title="If you don't want kids">
  <p>
    I expect to invest bandwidth in serious relationships with non-childrearing partners.
  </p>
</Admonition>

<Tabs lazy>
  <TabItem value="transparency" label="Transparency">
    I skew a lot toward public knowledge, I would never agree to a "don't ask don't tell" framing of polyamory. Open to discussing what exactly the expectations or obligations should be, but definitely want an agreed upon policy (whatever that might be) and don't want to ad-hoc everything all the time.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="veto" label="Vetoes">
    It's case by case, but I don't have a strong prior belief that allowing a partner to wield a veto over something in my love life is a signal of dysfunction. I can think of situations where spreading veto power around a polycule would be the right move, but I can also imagine cases where it would be the wrong move. I would be ok with a polycule that's strictly against veto power. 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="hierarchy" label="Words like 'primary', 'secondaries'">
    I think if I was raising kids with one partner and another partner wasn't involved, claiming that the poly is non-hierarchical would be a polite fiction. I think being realistic about what classes of things we can rely on eachother for doesn't mean that difficult tradeoffs would be happening super frequently.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="length" label="Expected non-childrearing relationship length">
    The truth is I have no idea, I can't predict what the conditions will actually be, but 6 months to 3 years is what seems the most likely. (In terms of what I <i>want</i> (rather than what I <i>expect</i>), I'd say 2 to 10 years, maybe more, who knows.)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Logistics/contact

<Admonition type="warning" title="Distance constraints for people who don't want kids" >
  <p>
    For people who don't want kids, I am not interested in relationships across an excess of three hours ground transport at this time. In other words, anywhere from DC to NYC is fair game!
  </p>
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Yes, willing to periodically fly for plausible coparents">
  <p>
    A long distance trial with plans to nest to test mutual fit for coparenting is open to a radius of about five flight hours, with a naturally higher bar for people further away. 
  </p>
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Prediction markets">
  <p>
    I will attempt to reach out to everyone who is nominated on <a href="https://manifold.markets/Quinn/who-will-i-date-2022">my Manifold Market</a>. You're encouraged to self-nominate on Manifold before emailing me but it is not a requirement. 
  </p>
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Assume a low bar for reaching out">
  <p>
    Do say hi even if you don't see us working, I'm ok with talking to random people. 
  </p>
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Partial fits">
  <p>
    I basically assume that about 60-75% of criteria needs to match for someone to be worth dating / checking to see if we can take on ambitious projects like childrearing together, but you shouldn't let your self-assessment of how well you fit this dating profile get in the way of reaching out (many people even think that humans are incompetent at designing selection effects intentionally, which in spite of writing this I put nonzero credence in).
